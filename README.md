# Dreamy Launcher

Dreamy Launcher is a hub for multiple different game launchers. 

At its current stage ( v0.1 at the time of writing this ) its very basic, sort of proof of concept if you will.

The launcher points towards default install paths for all 3 game launchers.


## Roadmap

**Scheduled For V0.2:**
- Allow for adding custom paths 

- Launch Steam in game mode

- Add Ubisoft support

**TBD:**
- Allow for adding different game launchers

- Ability to change themes

- If Default launchers ( Steam, Epic Games & EA ) arent located grey out option with a "Find Launcher" Button

- UI redesign ( will be done towards the end after all fundamentals are completed)
